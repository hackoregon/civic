# Code of Conduct

Everyone has the right to feel welcome and included at Hack Oregon. Our mission is to promote engagement and quality of life for all Oregonians. That same mission extends to all Hack Oregon events, meetings and gatherings.

The Hack Oregon Code of Conduct is a resource for Hack Oregon volunteers and anyone who chooses to participate in a Hack Oregon hosted event. To keep our community a welcoming and worthwhile place, all participants must adhere to the Code of Conduct.

At Hack Oregon, we seek to create an interactive, safe space place for everyone to connect, collaborate, and share their knowledge with one another. We welcome respectful differences of opinion and healthy debate. We do not tolerate behavior on or offline that threatens, harasses, or otherwise jeopardizes this community and any individuals in it.

## Harassment Policy

Hack Oregon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any meeting, workshop, hackathon, or class, including talks, Slack, email, Google docs, and other online media.

### Definition of Harassment: Specifics of Disallowed Behavior

Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. This behavior is not appropriate for any Hack Oregon space, on or offline.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. 

### Process for Handling Disputes and Complaints

We recognize that we draw on a diverse community, and not everyone will always agree. If you feel uncomfortable or misunderstood, we encourage a mediated, verbal resolution before resorting to a formal report.

However, Hack Oregon encourages reporting of all perceived incidents of discrimination, harassment or retaliation, regardless of the offender’s identity or position. Individuals who believe that they have been the victim of such conduct are encouraged to contact Hack Oregon immediately.

We take all of these reports seriously, treat them confidentially, and respect a victim’s choice in how to report or discuss any issues. You are encouraged, but not limited to, make your report to Cat Nikolovski, directly and immediately via email at catherine@hackoregon.org.
