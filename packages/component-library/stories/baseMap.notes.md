## Example: Use Container Height

This story shows how to make the Base Map's height responsive.

The Base Map component must be wrapped in a `div` for this to work correctly and its CSS `height` property set to `100vh`. You can also set a `min-height` property to prevent the Base Map's height from becoming too short.

This prop can be set in this story:

- **useContainerHeight:** whether the Base Map should adjust according to the height of its parent container
  - This prop expects a boolean
