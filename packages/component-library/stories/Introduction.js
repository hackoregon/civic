    <h1>Introduction to CIVIC's Storybook</h1>
    <p>Our Storybook shows how to use the CIVIC platform.</p>
    <p>It has a style guide and the platform components.</p>
    <p>Contributions to the CIVIC platform are welcome.</p>
    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>
      Component stories are in the /stories directory. They show a state of one
      or more UI components. (Basically a story is like a visual test case.)
    </p>
    <p>See these sample stories for a component called Button.</p>
    <p>
      You can add your own components as stories. You can also edit those
      components and see changes right away. Try editing the Button component.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Storybook is iterative and will be updated as the CIVIC Platform
      continues to grow. Please reach out to us in the SLACK #team_design
      channel with any questions about usage or suggestions for improving the
      stories.
