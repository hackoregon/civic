The Demo Card story shows the standard usage of the Chip for the CIVIC platform. Chip includes standard styling.

##Things it does

Props:

1. tag: Takes a string and displays it in the chip component.

2. color: Takes a color string (rgb or hex code) and sets the color of the tag icon to that value.

3. clickable: Boolean toggle that makes the tag look "clickable". Adds hover shading / mouse turns into pointer.
