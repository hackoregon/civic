    <p>The amount of money in our political system has been increasing over time, with a lot of focus on national elections.  Very little is known about how money influences our state and local elections. This project seeks to move beyond simply money in politics and national campaigns to examine how an increasing volume of money flowing into Oregon election influences who wins, and even whose name goes on the primary ballot. This project used data science, machine learning and AI to analyze data from over a million transactions totaling over $1.5B exchanged between candidates, businesses, PACs, unions and state parties since 2002, including the nearly 33% of contributions from outside Oregon.</p>
