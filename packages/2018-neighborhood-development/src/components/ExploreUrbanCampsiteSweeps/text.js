Larger areas (e.g. multiple blocks, natural areas) that were describe as as single sweep in the raw data were coded as a single point that estimated the location of the area (either via a centroid estimate by hand, or a corner of the polygon).";

Look by bridgeheads, along freeways (I-84 and I-205), as well as near natural areas (the I-205 Multi-use Path, Springwater Corridor and the Columbia Slough, for example). The five neighborhoods with the most sweeps are Buckman, Lloyd Center, Lents, Old Town/Chinatown, and Hosford-Abernethy.";
