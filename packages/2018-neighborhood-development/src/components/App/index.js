      Neighborhoods are more important than ever. With a volatile political
      environment, and general uncertainty of the future, neighborhoods are what
      bring people together to create a safe and healthy environment. But what
      is a neighborhood? Are neighborhoods defined by boundaries/polygons on a
      map? Zoning, buildings, and tax lots? The environment? The people who live
      there?
    </p>
    <p>
      Neighborhood development changes landscapes, buildings, as well as the
      people who inhabit and spend time there. Our data dive focuses on a single
      dimension of development: the movement of people around Portland and a
      sense of place.

      Migration of people within Portland's neighborhoods is apparent within the
      population of Portland's registered voters from 2006-2016. The age
      demographics of Portland's neighborhoods have been shifting; we tracked
      Portland's old and young voters as they moved around the city over time.
