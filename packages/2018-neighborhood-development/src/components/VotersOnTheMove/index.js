        are moving, broken up by age group.

      <p>Age is calculated at the time of relocation. Portland city center 
        is defined as the center of burnside bridge. Change in distance from Portland
        city center is calculated by taking the displacement from the individualâ€™s previous
        address. The scatter plot shows when people relocate from their previous address, 
        the direction and the distance moved either toward or away from the city center.
