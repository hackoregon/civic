      Data released in 2017 from TriMet shows a plateau in public transit
      ridership over the last 10 years, a pattern which appears to be consistent
      across the nation. This plateau in ridership doesnâ€™t point to a single
      variable, but through complex analysis we can begin to gather insight
      regarding equity and mobility in cities.
