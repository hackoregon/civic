## Civic Sandbox

The Civic Sandbox is a data exploration tool that is a part of
the Civic Platform. Unlike Story Card Collections, which show
a data narrative, the Sandbox is an opportunity for a user to
play with data on their own by mixing foundational polygon data and interesting slide data found across all our projects.
