  <StoryCard title="Unaccompanied Youth—Undercounted?">

      <p style={shared.text}>
        In 2015, 266 unaccompanied youth — people who are not part of a family
        with children or accompanied by a parent or guardian — met the HUD
        definition of homelessness, but only 5 documented homeless youth were
        under age 18.

      <p style={shared.text}>
        Five? The number seemed at odds with our team’s lived experience. So we
        spoke with the professionals at P:ear, one of Portland’s key non-profit
        organizations serving homeless and transitional youth. We asked whether
        younger youth were underrepresented in the Count.

      />

      <p style={shared.text}>P:ear said yes, and helped us understand why.</p>

      <p style={shared.text}>
        Over the past decade or so, eligibility for a range of youth services
        has expanded to include older youth — through ages 24 or even 25. What
        this means in practice is that organizations that once offered
        education, employment, health and related programs and services designed
        for 14 - 21 year-olds, are now serving young adults in their
        mid-twenties. As a consequence, younger youth are more selective about
        the services they seek and the organizations they tap. One of our
        experts pointed to the lack of common interests among 14 and
        25-year-olds. Another suggested intimidation as a factor keeping younger
        youth from asking for help from service providers — or participating in
        activities like the Count.
      </p>

      <p style={shared.text}>
        Another potential reason younger youth may not be represented in the
        Count proportionate to their numbers has to do with an increased
        emphasis on diversion. The goal of the County’s primary diversion
        program — Harry’s Mother, a comprehensive youth crisis center run by
        Janus Youth Programs — is to keep families together whenever possible.
        The theory here is to intervene early — helping younger youth who are
        runaways or are experiencing homelessness return home quickly with the
        support of counselors and other service providers that help keep them
        there. When this strategy succeeds, younger youth may experience only
        brief periods of homelessness and therefore be less likely to
        participate in the biennial Count.
      </p>

      />

      <p style={shared.text}>
        However, many younger youth seek to avoid exactly this situation. These
        youth may misrepresent their age or join “street families” to avoid
        exposure to authorities — including the police, the Department ofHuman
        Services, and, yes, even volunteers participating in the Count. Younger
        youth also tend to “double-up” with friends whose families are
        comfortable supporting them through a rough patch. These avoidance
        tactics offer another explanation for small numbers of younger youth in
        the Count.

        We also asked P:EAR about the potential consequences of undercounting.
        “When we don’t have an accurate count, observed John Phillips, P:ear’s
        Safe Space Coordinator, “we risk not solving the right problems.” He
        cited the plight of sexual minority youth as an example. “Forty percent
        of homeless kids are LGBTQ. For them, the streets may actually be safer
        than home.” We also asked John and his colleagues Sarah Louise Allen,
        Education Coordinator, and Beth Burns, P;ear Co-Founder and Executive
        Director, what one thing they wished more people understood about youth
        and homelessness.
      </p>

      <p style={shared.text}>
        Their responses were immediate and identical. “Being homeless is not a
        choice.”
