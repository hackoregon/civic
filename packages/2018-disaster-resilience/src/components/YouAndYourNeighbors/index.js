The <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/pbem/59630" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BEECN site</a> is a place to go in Portland after a major earthquake to ask for emergency assistance or report severe damage/injury. Places like hospitals, fire stations and schools will be rallying areas for the community and crucial for recovery efforts.
