           relative to key resources immediately following an earthquake.
           The <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/pbem/59630">BEECN site</a> is 
           a place to go in Portland after a major earthquake to ask for emergency assistance 
           or report severe damage/injury. Places like hospitals, fire stations and schools will 
           be rallying areas for the community and crucial for recovery efforts. Input your address,
            or a friend/family memberâ€™s address below to generate a personalized map.
