# Welcome to the CIVIC Brand

All of us connected to the Civic platform are the Brand. The logo, colors, typography, etc is all meant as shorthand for expressing our intent and values.

## Values

- Data for the People by the People
- Story over Framework
- Usable over Pretty
- Neutrality over Partisanship
- Inclusion over Specificity
- Clarity over Saturation

Our Storybook is iterative and will be updated as the CIVIC Platform continues to grow. Please make suggestions in the [civic repo](https://github.com/hackoregon/civic/).
