# Data Visualization

Our data visualizations demonstrate the power of the Civic platform.

## Purpose

Civic is a data platform. Our data visualizations demonstrate the power of
the Civic platform. Our platform shows the viability of an open-systems, open-source approach to public data. These guidelines outline our
approach to data visualization.

## Principles

Our data visualizations should:

- show the value of data in the hands of the community
- be legible, clean, and professional
- be aware of bias
- be accessible

### Embrace imperfection

Data-driven doesn’t mean unmistakably true because data and the tools that collect
it are human-made. Data is not pure fact, but evidence that filters
reality in a very subjective way. It has the unique power to abstract
our world and help us understand it, according to relevant factors that
are different or constantly changing. See [IBM data visualization guidelines](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/).

### Be aware of bias

A data visualization provides a lens and is a perspective on reality.
Bias cannot be eliminated. There is no such thing as an unbiased data
visualization. However, by being aware of bias, you can present the most accurate and useful perspectives on reality through your visualization. Generally, what is perceived as biased is based on the perspective of
the observer. What data is collected, how data is collected, how data is calculated, how data is categorized, how data is contextualized, what
data is presented, how data is visualized, etc... all inform bias.

### Show meaningful relationships

Data visualizations that show relationships imply meaning in those
relationships. Don’t make spurious relationship between disparate data.
You may have heard the phrase “correlation does not imply causation”.
Data visualizations that show correlation without context imply
causation.

### Data density - impress but don’t overwhelm

Our
data density should aim to impress but not overwhelm. Data
visualizations should be dense with information and detail - humans are
capable of absorbing a lot of visual information very quickly. However,
it is easy to overwhelm by showing too many different types of
relationships at one time.

## Chart Types

The Civic platform
uses a reusable component library. Basic components should be used where possible, and new reusable components should be built instead of
creating one-off visualizations. The currently library of components is
documented in the [CIVIC Storybook, Charts](https://hackoregon.github.io/civic/?path=/story/component-lib-charts--charts-style-guide).

### Bar chart

Vertical Bar Charts, also referred to as Column Charts, are used to compare
quantities of different categories or to show values over time. When
showing variables over time, you should choose a Bar Chart over a Line
Chart when the rate of change is more relevant than the relative
magnitudes. If comparing quantities of more than 5 categories, use a
Horizontal Bar Chart instead.

### Horizontal Bar chart

Horizontal Bar Charts are used to compare quantities of different categories (especially 6 or more).

### Line chart

Line Charts track changes or trends over time and show the relationship
between one or more variables. When showing variables over time, you
should choose a Line Chart over a Bar Chart when the rate of change is
more relevant than the relative magnitudes.

## Details

### Titles

All data visualizations should have a short, but descriptive title. It may
make sense to have a title as part of a card or as part of the actual
visualization.

### Labels

- Labels should be concise and descriptive
- If possible, label elements directly instead of a legend
- Use bold text only for emphasis
- Avoid type rotation

### Annotation

Annotation should be used to explain outliers and provide additional context.

### Tooltips

Our basic charts use tooltips to enable close examination of individual data points.

### Colors

### Showing quantities

Civic uses a number formatter to ensure consistent formatting across the platform.

- Commas
- Always use commas for thousands separator.
- Numbers and decimal places
    - Use units that will result in showing a maximum of 6 digits
        - Fewer digits is better
    - Lean towards showing 0-1 decimal places
        - Should reflect the precision of the data
        - Show whole dollars or dollars and cents (e.g. $123 or $1.23)
    - Examples
        - $7.3 million, not $7,300,000
        - 24%, not 23.79%
        - $535,000
    - Show units (e.g. dollar sigh, percent)

### Responsiveness

Our data visualizations should look good on a phone and on a desktop
computer. Generally, our approach to responsiveness is to scale
everything - text and chart elements together. This approach may evolve.

### Legends

If possible, elements should be directly labeled rather than using a legend.

### Proper scaling

Domain and scaling for axes should be set for each data visualization to ensure readability.

### Accessibility

We support accessibility for all visual disabilities by providing
alternatives to visual information, using text and tabular versions of
the visualization.

See [CIVIC Storybook, Accessibility](https://hackoregon.github.io/civic/?path=/story/design-ux-style-guide--accessibility).

### Interaction

Interaction should have a clear purpose.

### Small multiples

The pattern of filtering small multiples is one of our preferred design patterns.
