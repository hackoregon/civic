# Introduction to CIVIC's Storybook

Our Storybook shows how to use the CIVIC platform.

It has a style guide and the platform components.

Contributions to the CIVIC platform are welcome.

## Development

Component stories are in the /stories directory. They show a state of one or more UI components. (Basically a story is like a visual test case.)

See these sample stories for a component called Button.

You can add your own components as stories. You can also edit those components and see changes right away. Try editing the Button component.

Our Storybook is iterative and will be updated as the CIVIC Platform continues to grow. Please make suggestions in the [civic repo](https://github.com/hackoregon/civic/).
