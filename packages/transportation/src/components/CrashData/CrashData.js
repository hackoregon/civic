        <p>
          Hack Oregon partnered with the Portland Bureau of Transportation
          (PBOT) in support of the Vision Zero project. The mission of Vision
          Zero is to move Portland toward achieving zero traffic-related
          fatalities and serious injuries while providing safe and affordable
          transportation options and multiple opportunities for daily physical
          activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to our partnership with PBOT, we reached out to the Oregon
          Department of Transportation (ODOT) for the raw crash data* they have
          for the City of Portland (COP). They gave us a decade of crash data
          from 2004 through 2014, from which we were able to analyze how many
          traffic fatalities occurred in Portland across three modes of
          transportation - vehicle**, bike, and pedestrian. Here’s an overview
          of what we saw.
