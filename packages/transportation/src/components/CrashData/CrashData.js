        <p>
          Hack Oregon partnered with the Portland Bureau of Transportation
          (PBOT) in support of the Vision Zero project. The mission of Vision
          Zero is to move Portland toward achieving zero traffic-related
          fatalities and serious injuries while providing safe and affordable
          transportation options and multiple opportunities for daily physical
          activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to our partnership with PBOT, we reached out to the Oregon
          Department of Transportation (ODOT) for the raw crash data* they have
          for the City of Portland (COP). They gave us a decade of crash data
          from 2004 through 2014, from which we were able to analyze how many
          traffic fatalities occurred in Portland across three modes of
          transportation - vehicle**, bike, and pedestrian. Here’s an overview
          of what we saw.

          The SE Stark & SE 112th intersection is in the Gateway neighborhood,
          one block away from a lighted pedestrian crosswalk and within walking
          distance of Ventura Park. It is well lit on one side of the road and
          the posted speed limit is 35 mph. From 2004-2014 there were a total of
          nine reported crash incidents across all modes of transportation*,
          resulting in 10 injuries and two pedestrian fatalities. In one of
          those pedestrian fatality incidents the driver involved had a BAC

          Although there is a bus stop at the NE Sandy & NE 91st intersection,
          there is currently no designated pedestrian crosswalk across the five
          car lanes. It is surrounded by businesses, a market, and residential
          homes and has a posted speed limit of 35 mph. This intersection has
          streetlights on both sides of the road, but at night there is low
          visibility. From 2004-2014 there were a total of 10 reported crash
          incidents across all modes of transportation* at this intersection,
          resulting in nine injuries, one serious injury, and two pedestrian
          fatalities. In both pedestrian fatality incidents the pedestrians had
          a BAC level** of 0.42% and 0.30%, and the driver involved in one of

          posted speed limit of 50 mph. At this intersection there are three
          stoplights, a bike lane and is nested between the Hooper Detox
          Stabilization Center and Garden Garage which is attached to the Moda
          Center. The location makes it highly trafficked by vehicles, cyclist,
          and pedestrians. From 2004-2014 there were a total of 71 reported
          crash incidents across all modes of transportation* resulting in 100
