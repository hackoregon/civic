          Surprisingly, the vast majority (71.9%) of calls Portland Fire &
          Rescue responds to are medical, while only 3.2% of calls turn out to
          be actual fires. The remaining incidents are service calls, “good
          intent” calls, and false alarms.

              The Bureau of Emergency Communications (911) routes all calls to
              either PF&R, the Police Bureau, or ambulance services (and often a
              combination). PF&R personnel include trained paramedics who can
              respond to calls for any kind of medical emergency.

        <p className="Description">
          Portland Fire & Rescue divides the city into 31 Fire Management Areas
          (FMAs). We’ve mapped them against their specific demographic data from
          the 2010-2015 five-year average census to help PF&R better understand
          the neighborhoods they serve, and the dynamics that might impact
          emergency response times. Click on individual FMAs in the map below to
          see the demographics that PF&R was interested in, as well as average
          emergency response times.

      >
        <p className="Description">
          Over the past 7 years, on an average day, each FMA has fielded
          approximately 6-8 calls. Below is a breakdown of how the frequency of
          these calls change over the course of a day, and throughout the
          calendar year.
        </p>
        <p className="Description">
          The number of calls is fairly consistent across a calendar year, with
          some notable distinctions. There are more fire calls each summer, and
          as you might expect, July 4th typically has the highest number of
          incidents of any given year.

        <HowWhenBusy />
        <p className="Description">
          Call frequency ebbs and flows throughout the day, peaking during rush
          hour.

      >
        <p className="Description">
          Portland Fire and Rescue shows remarkably consistent response times
          across all FMAs. Below, we’ve charted response times vs. various
          demographic trends within each Fire Management Area. You’ll notice
          there’s no meaningful trendline, which is good: it indicates equitable
          response times across the city. We found no apparent bias with regard
          to population density, average income, or racial makeup of
          neighborhoods.
        </p>
        <p className="Description">
          There is one notable outlier to the above. FMA 27, a long, narrow
          region which includes the West Hills, has a significantly higher
          response time. One possible reason for this exception to the rule
          could be the particular terrain of the neighborhoods—the roads are
          narrow and winding. Perhaps they make it more difficult for large
          emergency response vehicles to navigate.
