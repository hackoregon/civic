        There could be some stagnation in the number of new people buying local
        food. Or as the USDA puts it, “a plateau in consumer demand for local
        food.”
      </p>
      <p className={paragraphStyle}>
        Rising demand in the last several years has lead to the opening of many
        new markets. There were 8,268 farmers’ markets operating in 2014, up 180
        percent since 2006.

        “In densely populated urban areas, farmers’ markets often compete with
        each other for vendors and consumers,” the report reads. “In other
        areas, newer, more strategically located farmers’ markets may lead to
        the decline of previously established markets.”

        Farmers markets may be a good marketing tool for a small farm, but they
        can be onerous to prepare for, with slim profit margins, says Sarah Low,
        a USDA economist and lead author on the report.
      </p>
      <p className={paragraphStyle}>
        Because of that Low says farms are increasingly using middlemen to sell
        to restaurants, grocery stores and distributors. With an increasing
        share of their produce, dairy or meat going to those channels, some
        farmers may choose to forgo the farmers market.

        Portland has a nation-wide reputation for being progressive consumers.
        This label holds up when you consider how many farmers' markets are
        available to Portlanders. It's clear that there is something about this
        city that attracts grassroot and local initiatives.

      <p className={paragraphStyle}>
        If complete saturation of farmers' markets means having an accessible
        farmers' market from every neighborhood in the city, then we have
        progress still to make. Portlanders living in the innermost (and also
        most expensive) neighborhoods have their fill of options, but
        neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city and in the suburbs need to
        commute for the same options.
