      Public transit is a key factor in the livability of a community, having
      deep impacts on traffic congestion, air quality, economic equity, and
      sense of place. Unfortunately, declines in public transit ridership have
      been observed in many American cities over recent years, while the costs
      of increasing traffic congestion on public health and well-being are
      expected to grow significantly.<sup>1</sup>

      In response to this trend, city planners in Portland, Oregon are taking
      steps to improve the movement of people in and around the metropolitan
      area. Central City in Motion, a recent, ongoing project of the Portland
      Bureau of Transportation (PBOT), includes a series of infrastructural
      changes meant to encourage transit ridership by increasing transit
      priority and improving service quality.<sup>2</sup>

      Among these measures is the conversion of regular traffic lanes along
      several major thoroughfares into Tactical Transit Lanes (bus-only and
      pro-time bus lanes), or TTLs. Such measures are inexpensive, can be
      implemented quickly, and can result in significant improvements to bus
      line performance.<sup>3</sup> Pilot programs in other cities have resulted
      in considerable improvements in performance;<sup>4</sup> at least one
      program demonstrated a 20-30 percent decrease in bus trip time.
