    <p>
      As many of Portland’s neighborhoods have gentrified, neighborhoods that
      were historically Black have seen decreases in Black populations. The
      Black population in the Portland region has proportionally decreased over
      time, demonstrating that the people displaced in these neighborhoods have
      not stayed within the Portland MSA.

    <p>
      Using Census data from Harvard’s Neighborhood Change Database (NCDB) this
      analysis shows the demographic trends in population change across the
      Portland region as a whole (top left) and in historically Black
      neighborhoods (bottom left). The neighborhoods considered “historically
      Black” can be seen on the map (on the bottom right). The tracts included
      in that definition can be modified using the slider above the map - which
      change the threshold for inclusion based on the percent of the tract
      population that was Black in the 1990 Census.

          This analysis aggregates tract-level population data by race from NCDB
          across the 4-county Portland region (Multnomah, Washington, Clackamas
          and Clark, WA); and across a subset of tracts in this case defined by
