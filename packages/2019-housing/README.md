## Housing Project

Provides assets for the Housing project for the 2019 Hack Oregon project season.

Designed to be copied when creating new projects for the 2019 Hack Oregon project season.

### When initializing a new project:

A common next step would be to create a card with the `yarn card` script and entering `2019-housing` when prompted for the package name.

> See the root README for instructions on how to create a card, navigate, and contribute to this project.
