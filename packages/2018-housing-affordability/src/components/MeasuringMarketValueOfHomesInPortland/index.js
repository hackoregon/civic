          Every year, properties are assessed for their total real market value,
          which includes the building and land value. Tracking how this value
          changes from year-to-year may be informative for identifying trends in
          the housing market and how different areas within the city are
          changing in value.

          Metro compiles data from Clackamas, Multnomah, and Washington
          counties. The records are created and maintained by county Assessment
          and Taxation offices. When interpreting this data, note that given the
          transfer of records between agencies, some data may not be completely
          up to date.
