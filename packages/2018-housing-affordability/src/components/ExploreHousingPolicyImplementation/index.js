        <p>There are a number of different housing programs and policies in place throughout the Portland metro area. 
          Theyâ€™re administered by various jurisdictions ranging from the city to the state level and at times, 
          these policies can be tough to interpret. 
          <br />
          <br />
          In the spring and summer of 2018,<a href="http://www.hackoregon.org/">Hack Oregon</a> volunteers surveyed local governments to understand what
          policies were being implemented. Taking inspiration from the <a href="http://www.hackoregon.org/">Housing Consortium in Seattle, WA,</a>
          the Hack Oregon project team created a framework of 22 policies impacting housing affordability in the region.
          To get the most accurate representation of policies being implemented, government websites were reviewed and 
          interviews with government employees were conducted in order to verify our findings.
