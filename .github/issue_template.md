# Story Card Request

**Project:**
**Card Title:**

## Description / Wireframe

> Include a detailed description and/or image that describes your story or visualization using
> the data described below. This can be as detailed as a wireframe, or as simple as a description
> such as a bar chart that shows variable A on the X-axis and variable B on the Y-axis.

> If you have a wireframe, include an embedded image of the card design by pasting an image from
> your clipboard or using the image uploader tool under this text box. This is mandatory before a
> front-end developer works on this ticket.

> Also include a link to a Figma design if you have one.

## Data Visualization / Design Concerns

> If you have specific design or data visualization concerns, mention them here

## Context

> Why is this important? This information will be used to prioritize and contextualize story cards.

## Data Details (APIs)

> Include all API calls that will need to be made, including all params and the possible
> values for the params. The more specific the better! This will help prevent back and forth
> and ultimately make for a quicker turnaround. Also include any calculations needed for the
> data recieved from the API

> If you do not have an API yet, it can be added later, but it is mandatory before a frontend
> developer works on this ticket.
